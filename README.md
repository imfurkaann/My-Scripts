I created this working file from the functions I frequently use, both to improve myself and to use them more quickly in my daily tasks. The code in this file helps me solve common problems I encounter, while also speeding up my coding process, creating a more efficient working environment. At the same time, the scripts Iâ€™ve developed to gain new skills and make better use of my existing knowledge have become an important resource for me.
